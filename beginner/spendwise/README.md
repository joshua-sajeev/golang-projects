### **Project Idea: Personal Expense Tracker**

**Description**:  
Create a simple web application using GORM, Gin, and SQLite to help users track their daily expenses. The application should allow users to create, read, update, and delete expenses. Each expense will have fields like a title, amount, category, and date. The app will also include basic analytics, such as total expenses and category-based filtering.

### **Features**
1. **Expense Management**:
   - Add a new expense.
   - Update an existing expense.
   - Delete an expense.
   - List all expenses with pagination.

2. **Category Management**:
   - Predefined categories: e.g., "Food", "Transport", "Bills", "Entertainment".
   - Option for users to add custom categories.

3. **Analytics**:
   - Display total expenses for a given date range.
   - Filter expenses by category.
   - Show monthly expense summaries.

4. **User Interface**:
   - RESTful APIs with Gin for CRUD operations.
   - Option to extend with a frontend (e.g., React or Vue.js).

### **Database Design**
Using GORM with SQLite:
#### Tables:
1. **Users** (optional for multi-user support):
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `username`
   - `email`
   - `password_hash`

2. **Categories**:
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `created_at`
   - `updated_at`

3. **Expenses**:
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `title`
   - `amount` (float)
   - `category_id` (Foreign Key to Categories)
   - `date` (datetime)
   - `user_id` (optional for multi-user support)
   - `created_at`
   - `updated_at`

---

### **API Endpoints**
#### 1. **Category Endpoints**:
   - `POST /categories` - Add a new category.
   - `GET /categories` - List all categories.

#### 2. **Expense Endpoints**:
   - `POST /expenses` - Add a new expense.
   - `GET /expenses` - List all expenses (with filters for category and date range).
   - `PUT /expenses/:id` - Update an expense.
   - `DELETE /expenses/:id` - Delete an expense.

#### 3. **Analytics Endpoints**:
   - `GET /expenses/summary` - Get total expenses for a given date range.
   - `GET /expenses/monthly-summary` - Get a monthly breakdown of expenses.

---

### **Daily Roadmap**
#### **Day 1**:
- Set up the project structure with Gin, GORM, and SQLite.
- Initialize the database and create migrations for the `categories` and `expenses` tables.

#### **Day 2**:
- Implement the category management endpoints (`POST /categories`, `GET /categories`).
- Create basic CRUD endpoints for expenses (`POST /expenses`, `GET /expenses`, `PUT /expenses/:id`, `DELETE /expenses/:id`).

#### **Day 3**:
- Add filtering and pagination to the `GET /expenses` endpoint (filter by date range and category).
- Implement the analytics endpoints (`GET /expenses/summary`, `GET /expenses/monthly-summary`).

#### **Day 4**:
- Test the API endpoints using Postman or similar tools.
- Add input validation and error handling (e.g., for missing fields, invalid data types).

#### **Day 5**:
- Refactor and optimize the codebase.
- Write basic documentation for the API.
- Optional: Set up a frontend (React/Vue) or explore Swagger for API documentation.

### **Stretch Goals**
1. **Authentication**:
   - Add user authentication and authorization using JWT.
   - Restrict expenses and categories to specific users.

2. **Frontend**:
   - Create a basic frontend using React or Vue.js for a user-friendly interface.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku or AWS).
