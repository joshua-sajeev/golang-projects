## Project: **Basic Calculator**

**Objective**: Learn basic syntax, variables, loops, conditionals, and functions in Go.

**Description**:
Build a simple calculator that takes two numerical inputs from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should prompt the user to select an operation and then return the result.

#### Requirements:
- The program should ask the user to enter two numbers.
- After receiving the numbers, the user should be prompted to choose an operation: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`.
- Based on the chosen operation, perform the corresponding arithmetic and output the result.
- Handle errors like division by zero.
